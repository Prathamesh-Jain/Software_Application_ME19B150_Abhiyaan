Previous Experience:
-------------------

Participated in Flipkart Grid 2.0 Intelligent Picking Robot Module.
  - Aimed to make a robot for intelligent picking & dropping of products at desired locations in warehouses
  - Headed a team of 4 members and developed algorithms using OpenCV and 3D model using Fusion 360.
  - Made to the semi-finals (top 40 teams among 1200 teams from tier 1 colleges) of Flipkart Grid 2.0

Trigger Word Detection
  - Aimed trigger/wake word detection algorithm like ‘Alexa’ for Amazon Echo, implemented using RNNs.
  - Used a 4-layer, A Conv 1-D layer, two GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) & a dense + sigmoid layer.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 94.6% using Adam Optimizer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function.

Obstacle Detection
  -  Aimed a real-time obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving using the famous ‘YOLO’ model.
  - Used a 19x19 grid with 5 anchor boxes; score-thresholding & non-max suppression for filtering.
  - Achieved real-time obstacle detection, using conv2d, max pool layers with batch norm & leaky Relu.

Personal Projects
  - Developing match prediction Algorithm for the ongoing IPL matches using different ML & DL Technique
  - Implemented face detection algorithm using OpenCV to detect drivers taking a nap while driving.
  - Built a Bluetooth enabled Car using Arduino Uno Microcontroller as a part of the IBot Club mini-project.
  - As a DIY Projects made an Artistic LED Frame which displays different light patterns using Arduino.
  - Made an RC Plane from scratch & learned about the aerodynamics and different sensors used.

Triphibian Robot, I-bot Club, IIT Madras
  - Working with a team of 13 members to build a robot that will operate on land, water, & air.
  - Learned and implemented algorithms for drone stabilization on air module & computer vision
algorithms for navigation & motion planning. Also did simulation in ROS using gazebo for the bot.

Why I want to work in the team:
------------------------------
The past year has brought to light the subject of Data Science, and it has turned to be of great interest to me, and since then, I have been in the quest to learn more through the medium of courses both at my home institute: Mathematical Foundations in Data Science, Probability, Statistics and Stochastic Process, Series and Matrices and online platforms: Deep Learning Specialization(by Andrew Ng), Advanced Machine Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data Specialization, and AWS Fundamentals wherein the courses were designed to provide both conceptual and hands-on learning. 
  Then I learnt about the work that is done in the software module at Abhiyaan and I was very excited to work as a part of this team. Moreover I always wanted to apply my knowledge in the real world and I feel that Abhiyaan can provide me with that platform. Now from the point of view of Team Abhiyaan I feel that my knowledge in the field of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data and experience in working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi in couple of projects can be a perfect match for the position of project member at the software module.
