Why I want to work in the team:
------------------------------
The past year has brought to light the subject of Data Science, and it has turned to be of great interest to me, and since then, I have been in the quest to learn more through the medium of courses both at my home institute: Mathematical Foundations in Data Science, Probability, Statistics and Stochastic Process, Series and Matrices and online platforms: Deep Learning Specialization(by Andrew Ng), Advanced Machine Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data Specialization, and AWS Fundamentals wherein the courses were designed to provide both conceptual and hands-on learning. 
  Then I learnt about the work that is done in the software module at Abhiyaan and I was very excited to work as a part of this team. Moreover I always wanted to apply my knowledge in the real world and I feel that Abhiyaan can provide me with that platform. Now from the point of view of Team Abhiyaan I feel that my knowledge in the field of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data and experience in working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi in couple of projects can be a perfect match for the position of project member at the software module.
